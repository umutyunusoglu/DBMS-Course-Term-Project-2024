# SabancÄ± University CS306 (Database Management Systems) Term Project

This repository contains the three phases of the CS306 Database Management Systems (DBMS) course project.

## Phase 1
Phase 1 focuses on applying SQL knowledge to design ER diagrams and implement these diagrams using SQL.

## Phase 2
Phase 2 involves creating a web page for the database designed in Phase 1. It also includes ensuring database integrity through constraints and stored procedures.

## Phase 3
Phase 3 is independent of the first two phases and focuses on developing a web application integrated with NoSQL databases. For this phase, we utilized Firebase Firestore to create a real-time feedback service between users and administrators. The system also supports user registration and login functionalities.
